### Introduction

Up to now, I have implemented volumetric clouds and atmospheric multiple scattering. The overall approach and the reference materials I used are listed below. Suggestions and corrections are always welcome. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at *1299003724@qq.com*.

This project is still ongoing and being updated......

#### Volumetric Clouds

###### Overall Approach
The creation of volumetric clouds is based on screen-space post-processing effects and ray marching. In my project implementation, I used Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) to perform ray-box intersection tests from the camera, and draw clouds within the bounding box. The creation of volumetric clouds mainly involves the following two aspects:

- Shape: First, sample the weather map to obtain the basic shape and distribution of clouds in the sky. This is then mapped to make the cloud shapes appear more natural. Next, sample 3D Perlin-Worley noise texture to get the base density of the clouds, followed by sampling 3D Worley noise texture to add detail to the cloud density(I have already added a noise generator to this project). Finally, use other noise to apply UV perturbations to the clouds, creating an animated effect of rolling cloud layers.
- Lighting: The scattering within the cloud layers is primarily Mie scattering, typically using the HG phase function as a substitute for the more complex Mie scattering. The absorption of light by particles within the cloud layers follows Beer's Law. Here, I used a function fitted by Guerrilla, which combines Beer's Law with the "Powder Effect".

#### Atmospheric Scattering
![showcase](https://github.com/Wunjo777/WorldEnvSystem/blob/master/mysky.png "Unity version:2022.3.17f1c1")
###### Overall Approach
I implemented atmospheric scattering by writing a shader for the skybox (although it can also be achieved through screen-space post-processing effects, using the skybox makes it much easier to obtain lighting effects). Atmospheric scattering is also based on the ray marching method, where rays are cast from the camera, and the remaining energy of sunlight reaching the camera after scattering through the atmosphere is calculated using various physical formulas of scattering. Since the color variation of the sky is mainly related to light scattering (Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering), I omitted the impact of absorption.

Atmospheric scattering ranges from simple to complex, starting with single scattering and progressing to multiple scattering. Single scattering is a simplified model and consists of three parts: transmittance, scattering, and transmittance again. Multiple scattering, on the other hand, is an integral of recursive forms based on single scattering and requires significantly more computation. In my project, I used research results from a paper published in 2020 to optimize the computation of multiple scattering. Additionally, I used a compute shader to precompute certain values for both single and multiple scattering, storing the results in lookup table (LUT) textures. This way, during real-time rendering, I can simply sample the textures to obtain the corresponding results, thereby improving performance.
